    "So far we have visualized relationships between two quantitative variables using scatterplots, and described the overall pattern of a relationship by considering its direction, form, and strength. We noted that assessing the strength of a relationship just by looking at the scatterplot is quite difficult, and therefore we need to supplement the scatterplot with some kind of numerical measure that will help us assess the strength.\n",

More importantly, there exists a numerical measure that assesses the strength of the linear relationship between two quantitative variables with which we can supplement the scatterplot. We will introduce this numerical measure here and discuss it in detail.\n",

    "We now discuss and illustrate several important properties of the correlation coefficient as a numerical measure of the strength of a linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The correlation does not change when the units of measurement of either one of the variables change. In other words, if we change the units of measurement of the explanatory variable and/or the response variable, the change has no effect on the correlation (r).\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, following are two versions of the scatterplot of the relationship between sign legibility distance and driver's age:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](../img/linear5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The top scatterplot displays the original data where the maximum distances is measured in feet. The bottom scatterplot displays the same relationship but with maximum distances changed to meters. Notice that the Y-values have changed, but the correlations are the same. This example illustrates how changing the units of measurement of the response variable has no effect on r, but as we indicated above, the same is true for changing the units of the explanatory variable, or of both variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "This might be a good place to comment that the correlation (r) is unitless. It is just a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The correlation measures only the strength of a linear relationship between two variables. It ignores any other type of relationship, no matter how strong it is. For example, consider the relationship between the average fuel usage of driving a fixed distance in a car, and the speed at which the car drives:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](../img/linear6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data describe a fairly simple curvilinear relationship: the amount of fuel consumed decreases rapidly to a minimum for a car driving 60 kilometers per hour, and then increases gradually for speeds exceeding 60 kilometers per hour. The relationship is very strong, as the observations seem to perfectly fit the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the relationship is strong, the correlation r = -0.172 indicates a weak linear relationship. This makes sense considering that the data fails to adhere closely to a linear form:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](../img/linear7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation is useless for assessing the strength of any type of relationship that is not linear (including relationships that are curvilinear, such as the one in our example). Beware, then, of interpreting the fact that r is close to 0 as an indicator of a weak relationship rather than a weak linear relationship. This example also illustrates how important it is to always look at the data in the scatterplot because, as in our example, there might be a strong nonlinear relationship that r does not indicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the correlation was nearly zero when the form of the relationship was not linear, we might ask if the correlation can be used to determine whether or not a relationship is linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The correlation by itself is not sufficient to determine whether a relationship is linear. To see this, let's consider the study that examined the effect of monetary incentives on the return rate of questionnaires. Below is the scatterplot relating the percentage of participants who completed a survey to the monetary incentive that researchers promised to participants, in which we find a strong curvilinear relationship:\n",

    "\n",
    "The relationship is curvilinear, yet the correlation r = 0.876 is quite close to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last two examples, we have seen two very strong curvilinear relationships, one with a correlation close to 0 and one with a correlation close to 1. Therefore, the correlation alone does not indicate whether a relationship is linear. The important principle here is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Always look at the data!\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The correlation is heavily influenced by outliers. As you will learn in the next two activities, the way in which the outlier influences the correlation depends upon whether or not the outlier is consistent with the pattern of the linear relationship."

In order to be able to do that, we need to summarize the linear relationship with a line that best fits the linear pattern of the data.

    "Prediction for ranges of the explanatory variable that are not in the data is called extrapolation. Since there is no way of knowing whether a relationship holds beyond the range of the explanatory variable in the data, extrapolation is not reliable, and should be avoided. In our example, like most others, extrapolation can lead to very poor or illogical predictions."

While it might be true that U.S. students differ in math ability from other students—i.e. due to differences in educational systems—we can't conclude that a student's country of origin is the cause of the disparity. One important **lurking variable** that might explain the observed relationship is the educational level of the two populations taking the SAT Math test. In the United States, the SAT is a standard test, and therefore a broad cross-section of all U.S. students (in terms of educational level) take this test. Among all international students, on the other hand, only those who plan on coming to the U.S. to study, which is usually a more selected subgroup, take the test.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's start with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Hospital Death Rates\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:** A government study collected data on the death rates in nearly 6,000 hospitals in the United States. These results were then challenged by researchers, who said that the federal analyses failed to take into account the variation among hospitals in the severity of patients' illnesses when they were hospitalized. As a result, said the researchers, some hospitals were treated unfairly in the findings, which named hospitals with higher-than-expected death rates. What the researchers meant is that when the federal government explored the relationship between the two variables—hospital and death rate—**it also should have included in the study (or taken into account) the lurking variable—severity of illness.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a simplified version of this study to illustrate the researchers' claim, and see what the possible effect could be of including a lurking variable in a study. (Reference: Moore and McCabe (2003). Introduction to the Practice of Statistics.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following two-way table, which summarizes the data about the status of patients who were admitted to two hospitals in a certain city (Hospital A and Hospital B). Note that since the purpose of the study is to examine whether there is a \"hospital effect\" on patients' status, \"Hospital is the explanatory variable, and \"Patient's Status\" is the response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](../img/causation7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When we supplement the two-way table with the conditional percents within each hospital:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](../img/causation8.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "we find that Hospital A has a higher death rate (3%) than Hospital B (2%). Should we jump to the conclusion that a sick patient admitted to Hospital A is 50% more likely to die than if he/she were admitted to Hospital B? **Not so fast ...**\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe Hospital A gets most of the severe cases, and that explains why it has a higher death rate. In order to explore this, we need to **include (or account for) the lurking variable \"severity of illness\" in our analysis.** To do this, we go back to the two-way table and split it up to look separately at patents who are severely ill, and patients who are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](../img/causation9.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, Hospital A did admit many more severely ill patients than Hospital B (1,500 vs. 200). In fact, from the way the totals were split, we see that in Hospital A, severely ill patients were a much higher proportion of the patients—1,500 out of a total of 2,100 patients. In contrast, only 200 out of 800 patients at Hospital B were severely ill. To better see the effect of including the lurking variable, we need to supplement each of the two new two-way tables with its conditional percentages:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](../img/causation10.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that despite our earlier finding that overall Hospital A has a higher death rate (3% vs. 2%), when we take into account the lurking variable, we find that actually it is Hospital B that has the higher death rate both among the severely ill patients (4% vs. 3.8%) and among the not severely ill patients (1.3% vs. 1%). **Thus, we see that adding a lurking variable can change the direction of an association.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever including a lurking variable causes us to rethink the direction of an association, this is called **Simpson's paradox.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The possibility that a lurking variable can have such a dramatic effect is another reason we must adhere to the principle:\n",
