A study was conducted by a concerned health group in which 54 major hot dog brands were examined, and their calorie contents recorded.

The purpose of the study was to examine whether the number of calories a hot dog has is related to (or affected by) its type. (Reference: Moore, David S., and George P. McCabe (1989). Introduction to the Practice of Statistics. Original source: Consumer Reports, June 1986, pp. 366-367.)\n",

The median number of calories in poultry hot dogs (113) is less than the median (and even the first quartile) of either of the other two distributions (medians 152.5 and 153). The spread of the three distributions is about the same, if IQR is considered (all slightly above 40), but the (full) ranges vary slightly more (beef: 80, meat: 88, poultry: 66). The general recommendation to the health-conscious consumer is to eat poultry hot dogs. It should be noted, though, that since each of the three types of hot dogs shows quite a large spread among brands, simply buying a poultry hot dog does not guarantee a low-calorie food.\n",
